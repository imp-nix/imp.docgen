Collection of functions useful for debugging
broken nix expressions.

* `trace`-like functions take two values, print
  the first to stderr and return the second.
* `traceVal`-like functions take one argument
  which both printed and returned.
* `traceSeq`-like functions fully evaluate their
  traced value before printing (not just to “weak
  head normal form” like trace does by default).
* Functions that end in `-Fn` take an additional
  function as their first argument, which is applied
  to the traced value before it is printed.
